# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering with Python | Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to segment customers using K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique. Customer segmentation involves dividing n customers into k groups based on similarities among them. The goal is to understand and relate to customers in each segment effectively to maximize their value to the business.

## Workflow
1. **Customer Data**: Collect the necessary data from all customers.
2. **Data Pre-processing**: Prepare the raw data to make it suitable for machine learning models.
3. **Data Analysis**: Extract useful information from large datasets to identify patterns and trends.
4. **Choose Optimum Number of Clusters**: Determine the optimal number of clusters using the "elbow method."
5. **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**: Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers.
6. **Visualizing the Clustering**: Visualize the clustering results to understand the customer segments.

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: Standard for working with numerical data in Python.
- **Pandas**: Python library used for working with datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **scikit-learn (SK Learn)**: Python library to implement machine learning models and statistical modeling.
