Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering with Python | machine Learning

Agenda:- To divide n customers into k groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group. The goal of segmenting customers is to decide how to relate to customers in each segment in order to maximize the value of each customer to the business.

Workflow:-
	Step 1: Customer Data
		Collect the required data from all the customers.
	Step 2: Data Pre-processing
		Preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a
machine learning model. 	
Step 3: Data Analysis
	Extracting useful information from large datasets to
identify patterns and trends.
Step 4: Choose optimum number of clusters
	To determine the optimal number of clusters, we 
have to select the value of k at the "elbow,‚Äù ie 
the point after which the distortion/inertia starts
decreasing in a linear fashion.
Step 5: K means clustering algorithm
		Feed the data to the K means clustering algorithm
and get the output.
Step 6: Visualizing the Clustering.
	Get the output by visualizing it through the help of a graph.
